            Interests:
        </h4>
        <p>
            I love sports. Football and baseball are my two favorites. If I am not watching or playing sports you can often find me relaxing in my home with my family or playing games or up in the mountains scouting out my next hunt. My wife and Daughter are my world and the hard work I am putting into my education and career is for them. I cannot wait to begin my career and give my family a good life.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Career Goals:
        </h4>
        <p>
            I love the analytical side of sports and I hope to apply my technical skills to that world. There are interesting applications for data analytics in both football and baseball, I would love to get involved with a professional team and contribute to an organizations success.
